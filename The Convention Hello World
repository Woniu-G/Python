By python version 3, they disabled some feature command that work in version 2
First, lets go with a working hello world
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!

However, if we did this, which was ok back in version2
>>> print"Hello World"
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Now, they aren't like php, they are strict,c++ command would not work
>>> printf("1")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#2>", line 1, in <module>
    printf("1")
NameError: name 'printf' is not defined

So here we go!
>>> print("hello")
hello
